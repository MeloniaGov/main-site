<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
    The Republic of Melonia is a Constitutional Republic government in a Minecraft server with a democratically elected President, Speaker of Parliament and Members of Parliament. The President appoints a Prime Minister, who then appoints ministers of "Cabinets" to execute the law. Citizens are to abide by the government's laws and regulations, and in return receive services.<br><br>

    We have fun building and expanding the Republic as a tight-knit community, with leadership and 24-page Constitutions along the way.

<h2 class="mt-4">Founding</h2>
<p>
    Before Melonia was even created, the founders of the city decided to vote on which type of government to adopt. Options flew around, anywhere from communism, to monarchism, to the representative city-state, which Melonia chose as its government to begin with. (Melonia is now a semi-presidential republic.)<br><br>

    The area that is now Melonia was discovered by three people who were scouting land for a potential city; TheRandomMelon (Michael), JosephineMira, and tz_scion. They agreed that this land would be perfect for the city, and began to build. JosephineMira did a lot of initial terraforming, making the initially stone mountain area into a grassy mountain that was far flatter where the city was to be placed. The first buildings to exist in Melonia were the three's houses; Scion's first, then Mira's, then Michael's.<br><br>

    From there, the first street was created for these three houses to sit on; aptly named Main Street. This street still exists today, although it is much larger.<br><br>

    Other people began to settle the land, including cstro216 and IsoKamikaze. A quick election was held soon after, determining the initial makeup of the Melonian government; Michael Webb (TheRandomMelon) as Mayor (known today as President), JosephineMira as Vice Mayor (known today as Prime Minister), and Scion (now Prime Minister) and cstro as Senators (known today as Members of Parliament). All of these candidates ran unopposed. Blake would not be appointed as Secretary (known today as Minister) of City Planning until the next day.

<h2 class="mt-4">Transition to the Republic of Melonia Government</h2>
<p>
    President Michael Webb, along with Cieurnish Minister of Foreign Affairs Bannerman, introduced the idea of the Republic of Melonia government. This nation uses a semi-presidential system. In this system, you elect two people for these two positions: President and a Member of Parliament to represent you. The President appoints a Prime Minister, who is head of the cabinet, and then the PM appoints appoint a cabinet, which is then approved by the Parliament. The Parliament approves the Prime Minister as well.<br><br>

    The President is head-of-state, mostly doing things like executing foreign affairs, giving speeches, being allowed to expunge criminals, etc, while the Prime Minister runs the day-to-day affairs of the government, and more directly affects citizens. The Parliament can kick the Prime Minister or any Cabinet members out at any time with a majority “vote of no confidence”.<br><br>
    
    This concept was deliberated on for quite some time, until finally, on August 21, 2022, the City of Melonia officially adopted the new Constitution of the Republic of Melonia, officially transitioning the City government to the brand new Republic.
