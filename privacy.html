        The Republic of Melonia created and currently maintain official accounts on both Mastodon and X (formerly Twitter) to better engage with the Melonia public.
        Activity on X and Mastodon is governed by their respective privacy policies. Consequently, you should review their privacy policies before using it to ensure an understanding of how your information may be used. You should also adjust the privacy settings of your account(s) on these platforms to match your preferences.<br><br>

        The Republic of Melonia may archive information that users send when engaging with any of its accounts (e.g., by sending a direct message, posting a reply, following an account, etc). This may contain personal information, such as the account's username and other account information, given such information is available based on the userâ€™s privacy settings and Mastodon/X's terms of service.
