    Statement on the Opening of the Public Villager Trading Hall - November 17, 2023
</div>

<br /><br>

Ladies and gentlemen of Melonia,<br><br>

All three floors of the Public Trade Hall are now open! The trade hall can be found in Haigdin on 2 Park Street. This trade hall consists of 18 villagers for all job types (except librarians) and iron golems on leads to keep them safe. There are 36 librarians, each with a unique enchanted book for trade. I would like to thank everyone who has assisted with this project, namely M.P. Sock/Buzzy_The_Bee for supplying materials and President Scion for assisting with the build and villager transport.<br><br>

While construction of the trade hall is complete, the next government project requires villagers as well and as such the dirt breeder will remain on site until villagers can be transported to the new location.
