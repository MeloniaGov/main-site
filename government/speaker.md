## Introduction
**Scion**, also known by his username tz_scion, is the current Speaker of Parliament, the Minister of Finance, the Minister of State, and the Minister of Architecture of the Republic of Melonia. He was appointed to the Minister positions by President Michael Webb on July 15, 2022 (Finance), and February 16, 2023 (State and Arcitecture), and unanimously confirmed by the Parliament all three times. After now-former Prime Minister Mira announced their resignation from Prime Ministerialship, President Webb decided to appoint Scion to replace Mira. Scion held the Prime Minister position from August 15, 2022 to February 15, 2023 due to political disagreements between President Webb and Scion. Webb chose a different candidate for PM instead, leaving Scion to run for Speaker of Parliament instead, and defeated incumbent lainuel to take this spot. Scion helped found the Melonian Representative Party, a political party which aims to keep Melonia growing and flourishing as a representative democracy, but is now a member of the CalvinBall Party, which aims to provide the best experience and level the playing field for all citizens, new and old.
