## Introduction
**Buzzy_The_Bee**, also known by her nickname **Sock**, is a current Member of Parliament of the Republic of Melonia. Before winning her M.P. seat, Sock frequently attended Parliament meetings, voicing her opinion when the Speaker and the M.P.s were deliberating on bills. This led to her reputation skyrocketing in the Melonian community as a citizen who used her rights as a citizen to voice her opinion before the government, which has not been very common in Melonia before she joined.
