He previously was a Member of Parliament and a Minister of Tax Collection in 2022 before he resigned and gave up his citizenship due to strong disagreements with the Melonian government regarding a foreign policy issue. He returned during the October 15, 2023 election cycle, running with his newly-founded party, the Democratic Union Party, which sought above all to unite Cieurnia and Melonia.
